> This web application allows pet owners to connect with pet lovers willing to provide pet-sitting services. This application also allows all users to make blog like posts that will appear in a feed for everyone. The motivation behind this project was to fill the gap of pet owners often times not having many options when having to leave their pets behind. We have a passion for pets and want to take the stress off owners and their pets by giving the owner as many options as possible with the ability to cater to their pets needs.
